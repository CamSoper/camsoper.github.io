### Developer Relations | Technical Education | Open Source Advocate  

#### Hi! üëãüèª I'm Cam. üòä

I thrive on mastering complex topics and making them accessible‚Äîwhether through code, documentation, training, livestreams, or one-on-one collaboration. I don't just build things; I learn deeply, then share that knowledge in ways developers and teams can relate to and put to use immediately.

My career has spanned open source, developer relations, technical content, cloud architecture, AI-driven development, and more. At Microsoft, I contributed to Azure and .NET documentation, developed training modules on Microsoft Learn, and built AI-driven content tools to help developers work smarter. I partnered with Scott Hanselman‚Äôs .NET community team to build educational video series, live learning events, virtual conferences, and hundreds of hours of community-focused livestreams.

Prior to that, my time as a Premier Field Engineer gave me the opportunity to master sharing knowledge in more intimate settings, delivering support and training to public and private sector customers of all sizes.

Beyond my professional experience, I have a breadth of technical interests that inspire me to share knowledge. I‚Äôm passionate about IoT, and that obsession led me to build a BBQ smoker powered by .NET‚Äîwhich, naturally, also resulted in me writing the official .NET IoT Libraries documentation. My love of IoT extends to Home Assistant, where I‚Äôve been integrating AI vision into household workflows to do useful things like tell me who's at the door or if the dog wants in.

I love open source, and I relish working in the open whenever possible. From contributing to .NET docs to ensuring my training materials live where developers can learn from (and improve!) them, I believe in collaboration, transparency, and community-driven innovation.

Now, I‚Äôm looking for my next opportunity where I can continue blending developer education, AI-driven development, and open-source collaboration to support technical communities. Whether it's working hands-on with developers, creating learning content, or driving strategic engagement, I bring deep technical expertise and a passion for making complex topics approachable.

Let‚Äôs chat! If you love developers, open source, or AI-driven workflows, we‚Äôll probably get along. If you also love BBQ, we‚Äôll be best friends.
