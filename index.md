# Hi! 👋🏻 I'm Cam. 😊

Throughout my career, I’ve helped developers learn, build, and connect—whether through documentation, education, or community engagement. I specialize in taking complex ideas and turning them into something people actually understand. 

Please explore my [portfolio](portfolio.md) to see my work in action. I’ve included examples of my writing, training, and community engagement efforts, ranging from technical documentation to live-streamed events. I'm particularly proud of my [custom smart smoker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kJGRuXZ4kg) built with .NET!

If you're looking for someone who can connect with developer audiences across media, drive community impact, and turn technical expertise into real-world value, let’s talk. Reach out via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/camthegeek/) or [email](mailto:cam.soper@outlook.com) to chat.
