# Welcome

## Hi! 👋🏻 I'm Cam. 😊

I thrive at the intersection of storytelling, education, and technology. Whether it's developer relations, open-source advocacy, or technical writing, I make sure complex topics become approachable and engaging. If you're looking for someone who can connect with developer audiences across media, drive community impact, and turn technical expertise into real-world value, let’s talk.
