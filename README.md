# Welcome! ðŸ‘‹  

[This is my career portfolio](https://camsoper.github.io/), showcasing my work in developer advocacy, technical writing, and community engagement. I specialize in making complex topics accessibleâ€”whether through documentation, training, or live events.  

This repo also demonstrates a bit of automation magic: GitHub Actions automatically converts `resume.md` into a neatly formatted PDF, keeping things up to date with every change.
