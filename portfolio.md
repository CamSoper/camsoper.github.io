# Portfolio  

This portfolio showcases some of my favorite content projects, along with accompanying code repositories when applicable. Some projects include GitHub links that define dev containers with all the tools and dependencies needed to run the code. You can run the code in your browser with GitHub Codespaces or locally with Visual Studio Code.

## Documentation  

I was an author on the .NET docs team, where I wrote and edited documentation for .NET and ASP.NET Core across the entire documentation portfolio. I also created the entire set of .NET IoT documentation, bridging hardware integration with .NET development.

- **.NET IoT Libraries Documentation**  
  *The complete documentation for the .NET IoT Libraries, covering hardware integration, libraries, and best practices.*  
  [View Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/iot/)
