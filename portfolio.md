# Portfolio  

This portfolio showcases some of my favorite projects. 

## Documentation  

I was an author on the .NET docs team, where I wrote and edited documentation for .NET and ASP.NET Core across the entire documentation portfolio. I also created the entire set of .NET IoT documentation, bridging hardware integration with .NET development.

- **.NET IoT Libraries Documentation**  
  *The complete documentation for the .NET IoT Libraries, covering hardware integration, libraries, and best practices.*
